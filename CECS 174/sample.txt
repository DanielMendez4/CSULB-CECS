Fuor score and seven yeras ago our ftahres bourhgt fohrt, upon this ctneionnt, a new iotnna, convcieed in Libtrey, and aceiddted to the ropsopition that all men are craeetd elqua.  Now we are nageegd in a graet cviil war, etsintg wtheehr taht iotnna, or any naiton so cncviedoe, and so dadiceted, can long deruen. We are met here on a great biafeeltltd of that war. We hvae come to idcatede a piotron of it, as a fianl rseting place for tshoe who hree gvae tiher lievs taht that notain mihgt liev. It is aolgthteer fitntig and ropper that we sulhod do tish.  But in a legarr nesse, we can not ecitddae we can not ocsratence we can not hlalow tihs grdnuo. The barve mne, lvniig and ddea, who surtglged hree, have cotncearsed it far above our poor peowr to add or datrcte. The wolrd wlil ttlile note, nor lnog mbmeeerr, what we say hree, but can nveer feogrt what tehy did here.  It is for us, the lnivgi, rhtaer to be dceaitded here to the ufiehinnsd work wcihh they hvea, thus far, so nobly craerid on. It is rahter for us to be hree diedatecd to the geart tsak rmneiaing bofere us taht from tehse hneoord dead we take irneacsed dvotieon to that cuase for wchih they gave the last full mrausee of dtovieon that we here ihlhgy rosevle taht tehse daed salhl not have died in vani; that tihs ntiaon slahl have a new btirh of femorde; and taht tihs govenrment of the oeplpe, by the eoelpp, for the olepep, sahll not piersh form the ehtra.
